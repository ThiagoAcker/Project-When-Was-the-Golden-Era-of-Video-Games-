# When Was the Golden Era of Video Games?
 ## This project was originally proposed by DataCamp's Data Scientist in Python track. You can check out the original notebook, context and proposal [here](https://www.datacamp.com/datalab/w/30db39ee-837c-4ef7-b4ea-b255211b1776/edit).
The project analyzes video game sales and ratings for the top 400 titles since 1977. I'll identify a potential 'golden age' of gaming by exploring critic and user scores, and investigate the business landscape by analyzing sales performance over time.
Questions
1. What are the top 10 best-selling games of all time?
2. Which years had the highest average critic scores?
3. Which years are considered the "Golden Age" of gaming, with high ratings from both critics and users?
