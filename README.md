# When Was the Golden Era of Video Games?
 ## This project was originally proposed by DataCamp's Data Scientist in Python track. You can check out the original notebook, context and proposal [here](https://www.datacamp.com/datalab/w/30db39ee-837c-4ef7-b4ea-b255211b1776/edit).
The project analyzes video game sales and ratings for the top 400 titles since 1977. I'll identify a potential 'golden age' of gaming by exploring critic and user scores, and investigate the business landscape by analyzing sales performance over time.
